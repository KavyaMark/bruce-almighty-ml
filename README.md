# ðŸ™Œ Bruce Almighty: A Data Science Twist

Inspired by the movie *Bruce Almighty*, where Bruce organizes prayers into a dataset,  
this project imagines: *"What if we used Machine Learning to handle the prayers?"*  

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Created a synthetic dataset of prayers/blessings.
- Performed **EDA** (exploratory data analysis):
  - Identified missing values and datatype issues.
  - Explored prayer subjects with **word frequency** and **word cloud**.
- Next steps: clean data, engineer features, and build an ML model to decide which prayers get granted, rejected, or kept waiting.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `bruce_almighty_eda.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with analysis and plots.
- `blessings_dataset_messy.csv` â†’ Original messy dataset.
- `blessings_dataset_all_waiting.csv` â†’ Cleaned version (all statuses set to waiting).

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Data cleaning (normalize urgency, convert scores to numbers).
- Feature engineering (categorize subjects, sentiment analysis).
- Train a classification model.

## ðŸŽ¬ Inspiration
Movie: *Bruce Almighty* (2003) â€” Scene where prayers are converted into data.

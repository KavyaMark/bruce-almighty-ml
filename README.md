# 🙌 Bruce Almighty: My Data Science Twist

This project was born out of a fun idea I had while re-watching *Bruce Almighty*.
There’s a scene where Bruce organizes all the prayers into a database.
I thought to myself: *“If I were Bruce, I’d build a Machine Learning model to handle them!”* 😅

So, I created a **synthetic dataset of prayers** and started exploring it with EDA.
This is my personal take on combining **data science + creativity**, turning a movie moment into a real (playful) ML project.

## 🎬 Inspiration
Movie: *Bruce Almighty* (2003) — the scene where Bruce converts prayers into data.
This project is **my personal spin** on that idea, blending creativity with machine learning.

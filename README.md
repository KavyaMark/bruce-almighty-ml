# What if Bruce from 🙏🏻 *Bruce Almighty* 🙏🏻 knew how to play with data?

*Bruce Almighty* is a fantasy comedy film (Wikipedia) that inspired this little project. ☺️  
The idea came to me while (re)watching *Bruce Almighty*. 😁  
(I also rewatched *Liar Liar*, *Hot Shots: Part Deux*, etc. 😌... What? 🤨 Comedy is always the best!!! 😁... No? 🫤)  

There’s a scene where Bruce organizes all the prayers into a database, and I thought to myself:  
*“If I were Bruce, I’d build an ML model to handle the prayers. 😎”*  

Since I couldn’t find a dataset online, I asked ChatGPT to create one with just 20 rows and a few columns (work smarter 😎, not harder 😏).  

This is what I would do if I had to **answer prayers** while God went on a nice (extremely short 😅) vacation.

## Inspiration
Movie: *Bruce Almighty* (2003) — the scene where Bruce converts prayers into data.
This project is **my personal spin** on that idea, blending creativity with machine learning.
